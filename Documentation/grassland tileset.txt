Tileset Art Asset List

2048x2048 sprite sheet
Each tile must be exactly 100x100 pixels
Each tile must be placed exactly within their cell, starting at the top left corner
This means the last 48 pixels on the right and the last 48 pixels on the bottom must remain empty
So pixels (0,0) thru (99,99) will have a single tile, pixels (100,0) thru (199,99) will have a single tile, pixels (0,100) thru (99,199) will have a single tile, etc.
Tiles can be organized within their cells, and blank/extra cells between sets are fine. But their cell can never change in the future.
Each tile must be on a separate layer.
More tilesets to come, including Castle, Water World, and Ice World. The tile-types must match the same positions across worlds.

Tilesets:

GRASSLAND
Primary tiles. Pleasant and colorful.  Seemingly peaceful area, altho it will have a lot of monsters. 9-slice + 4 interior tiles.
Hills. Grassland tiles that are angled.  Always connected to center-slice of primary tiles.  One for each angle.  (They are triangular). 4 tiles.
Water, for swimming in grassland. Top of water, and middle of water.  Will be connected to sides of primary tiles. 2 tiles.
Quicksand. Dangerous. To be placed with the grasslands. Top of quicksand, and middle of quicksand.  Will be connected to sides of primary tiles. 2 tiles.
One-way platforms. To match grassland tileset. For horizontal 1x1 and Nx1.  Always floating in the sky.  Skinnier than primary tile.  Only takes up roughly the top 20-50% of the cell.
Ladder, to be attached to grassland sides.  (can be vines, or ladder, or whatever. just something climbable). For vertical 1x1 and 1xN
